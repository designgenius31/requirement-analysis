# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.


## Introduction
This repository explores the **Requirement Analysis** phase of Software Development, one of the most crucial steps in building successful software products.

It includes examples, documentation, and exercises related to:
- Gathering and analyzing user requirements  
- Modeling system requirements  
- Writing acceptance criteria  
- Understanding functional and non-functional requirements  

The goal of this repository is to serve as a learning resource and reference for anyone studying or practicing software requirement analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** that focuses on understanding what a system should do and why it should do it. It involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders to ensure the final product aligns with their goals.

### Purpose of Requirement Analysis
The main purpose of Requirement Analysis is to clearly define **functional** and **non-functional** requirements before development begins. This helps developers and designers understand the scope, features, and constraints of the system to be built.

### Importance in the SDLC
Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring project success by:
- **Defining clear objectives:** It provides a shared understanding of what needs to be built.  
- **Reducing ambiguity:** Ensures that stakeholders, developers, and testers are aligned.  
- **Improving design accuracy:** Well-defined requirements lead to more accurate system design and architecture.  
- **Saving time and cost:** Detecting requirement issues early helps avoid costly changes later in the development process.  
- **Supporting validation and testing:** Clear requirements serve as the foundation for test cases and acceptance criteria.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. **Requirement Elicitation** – Gathering information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
2. **Requirement Modeling** – Representing requirements using diagrams or models.  
3. **Requirement Documentation** – Recording requirements in a clear, structured format.  
4. **Requirement Validation** – Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs.

In summary, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between stakeholders’ expectations and the technical implementation, ensuring that the final software product is useful, usable, and successful.
